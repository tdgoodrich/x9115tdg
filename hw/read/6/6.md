# READ6

## Datasets
In web-application-based dynamic testing, the following datasets showed up:  
1. READ1/2 used the same 6 open source PHP programs, and READ1 also contributed a set of bug reports.  
2. READ3 did not have any data, it was a survey paper of metaheuristics applied to non-functional property optimization.  
3. READ4 used a Java dataset of 4 programs historically used for penetration testing.  
4. READ5 used an open source PHP dataset of 3 websites historically used for penetration testing.  
5. READ7/8 were Mark Harmon papers proposing the future of SBSE when applied to difficult problems such as non-functional properties and dynamic content (e.g. web pages) -- these papers did not use any data.  

Due to not knowing the authors (and not asking for permission), I have not submitted a request to tera-PROMISE. However, I have included the above info so that anyone interested can easily contact the appropriate authors.
