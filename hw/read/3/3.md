## Paper reference:

Wasif Afzal, Richard Torkar, and Robert Feldt. 2009. A systematic review of search-based testing for non-functional system properties. Inf. Softw. Technol. 51, 6 (June 2009), 957-976.

The paper had 211 citations at time of writing.

## Keywords:

* ii1: **Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE)**: Applying metaheuristic search techniques (gradient-ascending, simulated annealing, etc.) to perform typical software engineering tasks (generating software tests, optimizing parameters, etc.).
* ii2: **Test adequacy criterion**: Test adequacy criteria is a set of requirements that evaluate whether a set of tests are sufficient or not. These criteria could include requirements about percent code coverage, which inputs are tested, etc.
* ii3: **Non-functional properties/requirements**: Non-functional properties/requirements indicate whether a piece of software is behaving correctly, but cannot specify particular behaviors. For example, properties such as speed, size, throughput, power consumption and bandwidth are non-functional, and the software requirements might specify ranges for each property; but the requirement cannot specify exact values.
* ii4: **Fitness function**: A fitness (objective) function summarizes a single attribute of a solution, particularly one used to gauge how “good” a solution is. For example, run time is a typical fitness function for algorithms. 

## Notes:

* iii1: Checklist: Right on the first page, the authors outline their research questions in detail:
    * RQ 1. In which non-functional testing areas have metaheuristic search techniques been applied?
After having identified these areas, we have three additional research questions applicable in each area: 
    * RQ 1.1. What are the different metaheuristic search techniques used for testing each non-functional property? 
    * RQ 1.2. What are the different fitness functions used for testing each non-functional property? 
    * RQ 1.3. What are the current challenges or limitations in the application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing each non-functional property? 

* iii2: Sampling Procedure. Given that this paper is a review, the authors spent some time outlining their systematic approach for sampling from the space of all research papers. Specifically, they used four rules for identifying papers:
    1. Identification of alternate words and synonyms for terms used in the research questions.
    2. Identify common non-functional properties for searching.
    3. Use of Boolean `OR` to join alternate words and synonyms.
    4. Use of Boolean `AND` to join major terms.
In addition to the rules, they include the search terms used, the databases searched, and the final selection criteria. In total, they found 404 distinct papers. 
* iii3: Tutorial: After summarizing how the papers were found, the authors provide some useful graphics for understanding the area. The first one included here is a table of primary non-functional properties and the researchers associated with the area. The second identifies which algorithms are used for each non-functional property and the timeframe the work was done in. This latter table contains multiple interesting points – for example, both GA (genetic algorithms) and SA (simulated annealing) were initially used for non-functional properties in 1996, then disappeared for a few years, the showed back up in 2005 – 2007.

* iii4: Future Work: This paper in particular is a systematic review, and so the authors have good data on (a) the current state of the art and (b) what open problems exist. In particular, near the conclusions the authors have a large section on identified future work, including tables like the figure below. These double as a future works and a best practices section, showing off the limitations and highlights of current research.

## Improvements:

* iv1: An iterative process. This systematic survey outlines the authors’ initial research questions, how they turned the research questions into search queries, how they turned these queries into papers, and how the papers were parsed into results. One improvement the authors could make is to reformulate their research questions after this initial survey, and either carry out a second survey or note their questions for future consideration.
* iv2: Best practices? While the authors do a very good job reviewing the existing techniques, including their limitations and highlights, they do not give a good summary of when to use what technique. For example, they could provide a flow chart or decision tree, or a table of situations and the recommended metaheuristic. After reading the papers these authors now had a better idea of the whole picture than most anyone, why not make a useful method for choosing heuristics? 
* iv3: A suite of techniques. If the authors wanted to go a step further, once they understood the existing techniques for optimizing non-functional properties, they could organize the creation of an open source suite with efficient implementations of these methods. Again, the authors are now the leading experts in this area, why not organize some tangible products to clean up the area?
