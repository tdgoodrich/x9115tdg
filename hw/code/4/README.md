### Some Implementation Notes

1. The neighbor solution is computed by choosing (uniformly at random) another real number within (euclidean) distance _radius_ (a parameter to this algorithm implementation). By default I set _radius=500_
2. I went ahead and seeded the random, in case anyone wants to reproduce.
